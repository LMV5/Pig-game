# PIG GAME üê∑.

This project is a simple dice game.
The purpose of the game is to be the first player to reach a total score of 100 points. 
Players take turns rolling a dice and accumulating points. If a player rolls a 1, they lose their current score, and it becomes the next player's turn. 
Players can choose to hold their current score, which adds it to their total score, but also ends their turn.
